Oh My Zsh has a [VIM mode plugin](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/tree/master/plugins/vi-mode)! I am not sure how I missed this.

To activate, open your `~/.zshrc` and add vi-mode to your plugins. e.g.

    plugins=(git vi-mode)

Restart your Terminal session.

Your session is in `Insert` mode by default.

Hit escape for `Normal` mode, and you are ready to enjoy your basic VIM bindings for navigating
your CLI.
