This is a blog about code and reflections on technology in the midst of a unprecedented era of technological innovation at a breath-taking (and perhaps perilous) speed.



What is the judgment of Thamus? In his book [Technopoly](https://books.google.com/books?id=gYrIVidSiLIC&pg=PT12&dq=Technopoly+AND+Thamus&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ClYtVZbzNtCrogSDm4DYCQ&ved=0CCQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=Technopoly%20AND%20Thamus&f=false),
Neil Postman offers a counterweight to the blind adoption of technology.



While he makes it clear that he is not anti-technology, he sounds a warning. Thamus was incorrect
in that he assumed technology would only be a burden.


However, Postman claims (rightly in my estimation):


> We are currently surrounded by throngs of zealous Theuths, one-eyed prophets who can only see what
> new technologies can do and are incapable of imagining what they will undo.



Technology gives, and it takes away. It is not an either-or proposition, and it is not neutral. I am pro-technology, but
with both eyes open.



I am a Christian. For my reflections on the good news about Jesus, see my blog [Strangers and Exiles](http://strangersandexiles.com).
